# Chat Service [combo with GPT]

Welcome to my chat service repository! In this project, I will be building a chat service using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) as a messaging broker.

I will be using code generated by [chatgpt](https://github.com/polyAI-limited/chatgpt) and [GPT-3](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt3) to help with the natural language processing aspect of the chat service. [Well, not exactly gee-pee-tee, you will be writing most of the actual code!]

I will be reviewing and completing this code to make it functional for my chat service.

This project is still a work in progress, so stay tuned for updates! If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Thanks for visiting!

*Note: The [draft] text was also generated by chatGPT [and later edited by me].*
